/* This is the generic version of the cancellable syscall code which
   adds the label guards (__syscall_cancel_arch_{start,end}) used
   on SIGCANCEL handler (sigcancel_handler at nptl-init.c) to check if
   the cancelled syscall have side-effects that need to be signaled to
   program.

   An important contrainst should be observed when using this generic
   implementation: the __syscall_cancel_arch_end should point to the
   immediate next instruction after the syscall one.  This is because
   kernel will signal interrupted syscall with side effects by setting
   the signal frame Program Counter right after the syscall instruction.

   If the INTERNAL_SYSCALL_NCS macro use more instructions to get the
   error condition from kernel (as for powerpc and sparc), uses an
   out of the line helper (as for ARM thumb), or uses a kernel helper
   gate (as for i686 or ia64) the architecture should either adjust the
   macro or provide a custom __syscall_cancel_arch implementation.   */
